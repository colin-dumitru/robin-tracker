## robin-tracker

This project aims to automatically create a leaderboard for the bigest [Robin](https://www.reddit.com/robin) rooms.

Current leaderboard can be found here: http://colin-dumitru.github.io/robin-tracker/

### How to contribute with data
1. Go to any reddit page (preferably https://www.reddit.com/)
2. Open your browser's console (F12 for Chrome for Windows)
3. Copy and paste this script in the console: https://github.com/colin-dumitru/robin-tracker/blob/master/robin-tracker.user.js
4. Leave the page opened in the background. The script I pasted will periodically send the room name and number of participants of the current room you're in.
